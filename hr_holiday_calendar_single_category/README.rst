=====================================
   Leaves create calendar events with single category
=====================================

This module is an ad-don to ``calendar_event_tag_color``.

 When approving a leave, an event is created.
By default, events have many2many field for categories, with the modudle 'calendar_event_tag_color' it is reduced to many2one.

This module avoids a crash of types when approving leaves.
